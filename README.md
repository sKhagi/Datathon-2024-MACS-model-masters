# Datathon-2024-MACS-model-masters
Repository for Inter-Uni Datathon 

my_learning.ipynb is my attempt at exploring, implementing and collating what I learnt in the UNSW Datathon 2024. 
Our competition model had a 0.88 f1-score at best but this implementation has a 1.00 f-score with both the RandomForestClassifier and XGBoost. Potentially due to how the features were treated, especially the most important feature (Transaction Time) since the XGBoost model performs very well with almost no adjustment.
