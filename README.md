# Datathon-2024-MACS-model-masters
Repository for Inter-Uni Datathon 

my_learning.ipynb is my attempt at exploring, implementing and collating what i learnt in the UNSW Datathon 2024. 
Our competition model had a 0.88 f1-score at best but this implementation has a 1.00 f-score on both the RandomForestClassifier and XGBoost. Most likely due to how the features are treated, especially the most important feature - Transaction Time.
